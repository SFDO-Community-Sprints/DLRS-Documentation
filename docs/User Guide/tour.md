# App Tour

## Declarative Lookup Rollup Summary

The DLRS app can be found in the app draw or the “waffle” in the top left hand corner. Just like any other Lightning App you can find all of the related tabs all in one place. Here we have the welcome page and along the top we can see Tools, Manage, Logs and List View. We can use this app to create, edit and view all of our DLRS.

## Lookup Rollup Summaries Tools

This section is still a work in progress, and will be added soon.


## Manage Lookup Rollup Summaries

Press Manage Lookup Rollup then select the Create New drop down menu. You can see that one rollup exists and it is called Total Invoice Amount On Account. You have the option of opening this existing rollup or making a new one. 


## Lookup Rollup Summary Logs

When you have been using this for some time your apps will generate logs which you can view in this tab. This is particularly effective for troubleshooting error messages and seeing which Parent Object the rollup points to.

## Lookup Rollup List View

All of your rollups will be shown here. We can see the label and the calculation mode on the left hand side. In the future you will be able to see an at a glance view of all of the rollups and their calculation mode.
