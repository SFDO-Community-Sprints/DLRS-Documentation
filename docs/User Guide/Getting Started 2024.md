3. Fill out the following fields. While not all fields listed below are required to save a rule, all fields below are required to have a working rule. <br>
        - Lookup Rollup Summary Label (Lookup Rollup Summary API Name will auto-populate) <br>
        - Child Object <br>
        - Field to Aggregate <br>
        - Relationship Field <br>
        - Parent Object <br>
        - Aggregate Result Field <br>
        - Rollup Type <br>

### Calculation Mode Fields

| Name | Description |

### Advanced Fields
_The fields below are used when the test code methods need to be edited for deployment or to maintain code coverage.
For more information please see [this example](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/issues/356) where these fields were needed._

| Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Test Code (Child Object) | Override the generated method body for the new test class used to test the DLRS trigger, useful if your child object needs values added, or other records created, to be successfully saved in Salesforce. |
| Test Code (Parent Object) | Same as above, but using Parent instead of Child |
| Test Code Sees All Data? | Checking this box tells the generated test classes that they can see your production data in the database when running tests. Not recommended but sometimes necessary. (No data will be harmed by using this setting). <br> For more information, [see here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_testing_seealldata_using.htm) |
