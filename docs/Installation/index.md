## Permissions

### Consider User Types 
Before selecting what users you want to install for, consider the types of users you will have in DLRS:
1. Admin
   - Can configure, activate and deploy rollups 
   - Needs full read/write access to all objects in the package
2. User
   - Indirectly invokes the rollups
   - Need read access to all objects 


### Selecting Users to "Install for"
In the installation process, when selecting what users to install for, you have 2 options: 
* Install the package for Admins only and then complete the "Assigning Permission Set" section below to open up permissions for users/profiles who need to access to edit and/or run rollups
<br>OR<br>
* Install for all users (no additional steps needed, however all users will have full access to all dlrs objects)

### Assigning Permission Set

- In Setup, search for "Permission Set" in QuickFind
- Once in the Permission Set area, click on the **Lookup Rollup Summaries - Process Rollups**
- In the permission set, click on **Manage Assignments** button. 
- From the page that is displayed you can create a List View to filter for the users you want, tick them and click **Add Assignments**.

- As needed, update **Profiles** by giving **Read** access to the following objects, **Lookup Rollup Summaries**, **Lookup Rollup Summary Logs** and **Lookup Rollup Summary Schedule Items**.

**Additional Resources**
- If you need a more detailed view of permissions, try out the free The Permissioner tool on [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000008XYMlEAO).

## Professional Edition

Use the links below to install into a Professional Edition of Salesforce:

**Sandbox & Scratch Orgs:**  
[https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5p000000Gey6AAC](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5p000000Gey6AAC)

**Production & Developer Edition Orgs:**  
[https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5p000000Gey6AAC](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5p000000Gey6AAC)

Note: Only the `Invocable by Automation` (labeled "Process Builder" in versions prior to 2.21) calculation mode is compatible with the Professional Edition because of the use of Apex Triggers in all other calculation modes.
